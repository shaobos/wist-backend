Maybe we can learn a lesson from Ms. West. It's not just what you've got, but also how you package it. Having the best ideas, the finest code, or the most pragmatic thinking is ultimately sterile unless you can communicate with other people. A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.

In computer science, more specifically in programming-language engineering, the term dichotomy can denote fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, C++ has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).

"'If you want innovation, then you need interaction,' he said. ³If you want productivity, then you want people working from home.'"

Their problems were exacerbated because of Jobs’s frustrations with Chrisann.
